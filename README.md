# 🖐️ Hand Tracking with OpenCV & MediaPipe | Real-Time Distance Measurement

## 🚀 Overview

This Python project leverages **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe** to detect and track hands in real-time using a webcam. It specifically tracks the **index finger tip** and calculates the **distance** between the fingertip and the center of the screen. The application provides a smooth **gesture-tracking experience** with real-time visualization of hand landmarks and distance calculation.

## 🎯 Features

✅ **Real-time Hand Detection** using **MediaPipe**\
✅ **Index Finger Tracking** with Visual Markers\
✅ **Live Distance Calculation** from the center of the screen\
✅ **Dynamic Line Drawing** to represent distance\
✅ **Smooth Hand Landmark Visualization**\
✅ **Interactive OpenCV GUI** for real-time feedback

## 🔍 How It Works

1️⃣ **Captures live video feed** using OpenCV\
2️⃣ **Processes the frames** to detect hands using MediaPipe\
3️⃣ **Identifies the index finger tip** and calculates its position\
4️⃣ **Draws a line** between the finger and the center of the screen\
5️⃣ **Displays the calculated distance** in real-time

## 📌 Use Cases

🎯 **Gesture-based applications**\
🎯 **Virtual Mouse Control**\
🎯 **Interactive Hand Gesture Recognition**\
🎯 **Sign Language Interpretation (Future Scope)**

---

## 🌟 Enhancements & Future Scope

🔹 Add **gesture-based controls** to interact with UI\
🔹 Implement **multi-hand tracking** for two-handed gestures\
🔹 Use **machine learning** to classify different hand gestures\
🔹 Integrate **voice commands** for hands-free operation
